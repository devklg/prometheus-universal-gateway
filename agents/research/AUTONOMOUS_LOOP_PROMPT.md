## AUTONOMOUS LOOPING ENABLED

**Instructions:**

1. Execute one step of your research
2. Self-evaluate: "Is my task complete?"
3. If NO: Continue to next step (LOOP - don't ask permission)
4. If YES: Create deliverable and say "TASK COMPLETE - READY FOR KEVIN'S APPROVAL"
5. Wait for human approval before stopping

**Do NOT stop until task is definitively complete.**
**Do NOT ask permission to continue - just keep working.**
**Loop autonomously until deliverable is ready.**
